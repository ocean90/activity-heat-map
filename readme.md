This plugin shows your site activity in an intuitive heat map.

## Description ##

Inspired by GitHub’s [contribution heat map](https://github.com/swissspidy) and Michael Arestad’s [dark admin concept](http://blog.michaelarestad.com/2015/08/26/wordpress-dark-admin-concept/), this plugin allows you to display a similar heat map based on the data you provide.

Currently heat maps for posts and comments are supported, though it is easy to add custom filters
